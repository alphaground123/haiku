Haiku compiles Markdown, Mustache, and any of your other assets to a static site via a CLI or a [Node.js][node] code API. This project is very much still a WIP. If you want to contribute hit me up on github or irc.

# Install

With [npm][npm] do:

    npm install haiku -g

# Example

# API Methods

    var haiku = require('haiku')

## var h = haiku([src || options])

Create an instance of haiku using the `src` path or an `options` object, if the `options` or `src` are omitted the defaults described below are applied.

* `src`: The source of the project or site, defaults to process.cwd()
* `content-dir`: the content directory where the markdown content lives. Defaults to the cwd + '/content'
* `build-dir`: where the compiled site will be saved to. Defaults to the cwd + '/build'
* `templates-dir`: layouts and additional templates go here, Defaults to the cwd + '/templates'
* `public-dir`: static content that does not need to be compiled can be saved, will get merged into the build directory at compile time. Defaults to the cwd + '/public'
