# Dependencies

You need node >= 0.4.10 and npm

# Development

To get started you will need to make sure you have all of the npm packages installed

    npm install
    npm link # wire up the bin

Right now the only command that works is:

    haiku --source examples/basic --destination build

This will build the html for any pages or posts that exist in the examples/basic directory of this project.

More is coming this is just a proof of concept at this stage
